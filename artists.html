                      <h2>Global Groove</h2>
                       <h3>Nam June Paik </h3>  
                      <br></br>
                      <p>Global Groove, a seminal work in the history of video art. This radical manifesto on global communications in a media-saturated world is rendered as an electronic collage, a sound and image pastiche that subverts the language of television. With surreal visual wit and an antic neo-Dada sensibility, Paik brings together cross-cultural elements, artworld figures and Pop iconography.</p>
                        <p>Pepsi commercials appropriated from Japanese television are juxtaposed with performances by avant-garde artists John Cage, Merce Cunningham, Allen Ginsberg and the Living Theatre; dancers moving in a synthesized, colorized space to Mitch Ryder's Devil with a Blue Dress On are intercut with traditional Korean dancers. Charlotte Moorman, her image wildly synthesized, plays the TV Cello; Paik and Moorman play the TV Bra for Living Sculpture; Richard Nixon's face is distorted by a magnetically altered television. In an ironic form of interactive television, Paik presents <b><i>"Participation TV,"</i></b> in which he instructs viewers to open or close their eyes. Paik subjects this transcultural, intertextual content to an exuberant, stream-of-consciousness onslaught of disruptive editing and technological devices, including audio and video synthesis, colorization, ironic juxtapositions, temporal shifts and layering — a controlled chaos that suggests a hallucinatory romp through the channels of a global TV. With its postmodern content, form and conceptual strategies, Global Groove stands as a seminal statement on video, television and contemporary art.</p>

                            <br></br>
                            <p>Murata engage in a process known as datamoshing where various software tools are used to enhance
                                video compression artifacts to the point where they overtake the original content of the
                                video, a deliberate creative misuse of tools that exist to enable the transmission of video
                                content through data networks by making them smaller, <b><i>'compressing'</i></b> them.
                                There is a bi-fold appropriation occurring in the act of  <b><i>'data-moshing'</i></b>; on one level as the
                                viewer of digitally distributed video whereby one observes the breakdown and degradation of
                                the image caused by problems with streaming, compression, and storage of video and, on
                                another, as the artists develop strategies to reproduce and control this effect.
                                Murata's and Davis' videos embody the <b><i>'remix'</i></b> notions by actively mashing multiple streams,
                                files, or content together to create new hybrids. In Murata and Davis' work the overriding.

                              <p>Amerika describes himself as a <i><b>"thoughtographer"</b></i>, an <i><b>"artist-medium"</b></i>, a <i><b>"fictional philosopher"</i></b>, a <i><b>"remixologist"</i></b>, a <i><b>"network conductor"</i></b>, a wanderer who constantly changes identities and roles in a fragmentary world where time acquires an a-synchronic and non real dimension. By trying to express the complexity and the interest of contemporary digital reality, he delves into different aspects of himself and draws on elements and traits that he transfers to the characters of his works, by using the media, the technological platforms of our time. Developing projects on the net, filming with mobile phones, remixing common moments and figures of today's culture in a VJ-like audiovisual rhythm, Amerika redefines the characteristics of today's culture and opens up the possibilities for new interpretations and thoughts from the audience itself. -- <i><b>"UNREALTIME"</i></b> at the National Museum of Contemporary Art in Athens.

                                     <h3>Eric Siegel</h3>  
                                    <br></br>
                                    <p>Eric Siegel was another forerunner. He began building TV sets in high school and has continued building video equipment ever since. He was also the builder of an early video synthesizer, and another tool, his colorizer, has been used by half the artists in the country who want color in their tapes. Siegel's own work ranges from an early special-effects tape of Einstein to more recent personal documentary tapes.
                                        </p>
                                        <p>Siegel's Psychedelevision consisted of three tapes: Einstein, a manipulated image sequence of Albert Einstein's face, where his features radiate color and abstract imagery; Symphony of the Planets; and Tomorrow Never Knows, accompanied by the Beatles song. Both of the latter tapes display psychedelic imagery in conjunction with music, and Siegel jokingly refers to Tomorrow Never Knows, as <b><i>"a kind of very early rock video."</b></i> Today, however, this work looks like much more. Siegel's exploration of relationships between abstract imagery and sound entails sophistication not unlike that in the experimental films of Oskar Fischinger.</p>

							​Marcus Boon describes <b>Clinamen</b> as:<i> “an inherent swerve in the basic constituents of the universe as they move in the ether, a swerve that results in the variety of the universe as we know it.”</i><p>
In the book: <i>On the Nature of Things</i>,  <i>Lucretius</i> describes the <b>Clinamen</b> as: <i>“at uncertain times and places <b>(incerto tempore, incertisque locis)</b> , the eternal, universal fall of the atoms is disturbed by a very slight deviation - the “<b>Clinamen</b>” (2.216 -292)</i>.” All natural things, such as the realm of compound bodies, are produced by the ensuing vortex.</p><p>
We can make the argument that the atoms could be seen was the images, texts, videos, sounds, etc. that exist on the internet (the universe) birthless and deathless just like atoms and that they are also in constant motion, causing slight variations or the <b>Clinamen</b> that result in the variety of the universe as we know it, creating infinite variations of new “atoms” which are represented in the print as the ever-changing illustration that first appears on the cover but slightly changes through the three main chapters named:  A universe of prefixes, A Void full of copies and  A Vortex of  Artists and that is a representation of the “conditions” necessary for the <b>Clinamen</b> to occur similarly to how it is argued <i>On the Nature of Things</i>.</p> <p>
In this project, we seek to explore how internet culture created an opening for appropriation, becoming something more tolerated in our culture, specifically how this culture affects art and its artists through our website and publication named <b>Clinamen</b>.</p>
